Hello, this repository and all materials created where done using chatGPT to help create the content of the document. 

This project was created to help me the developer learn to code and at the same time learn to use github.

I by no means own any of the content created in this repository, this includes all materials used to create this documentation. 

The information used in this documentation was found using chatGPT and various sources scattered throughout the web. 

This repository with its associated project were created has a fun project and by no means does it reflect a proper functioning developer toolkit document. I would advise anyone interested in using developer toolkits to search for widely recognized documentation regarding the use of developer toolkits.

I will be updating this repository daily (if possible) until I am satisfied with the completion of not only the html, but also the css portion of the project.

Along the way critique and suggestions will always be appreciated. Community support is always welcome.

Thank you and enjoy my fun little project.
